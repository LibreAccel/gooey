ðŸ“ˆ Gooey
========

What?
-----

A fast and slick alternative GUI for Raw Accel.

Can I use Gooey now?
--------------------

Gooey is currently under **heavy** development, use with caution.

Core Ideals of Gooey
--------------------

- A clean user-interface
- Understable, descriptive, and user-friendly input fields (+ localization)
- Customizable via UI editor (and scripting, maybe)
